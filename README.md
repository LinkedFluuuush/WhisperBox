# WhisperBox
A small module for Foundry VTT that adds the ability to create a dedicated box for whispering to a specific player.
When enabled, the module adds an icon to the bottom left of the Token Hud for any token that's portraying an actor bound to a player.
When clicked, this icon launches a dedicated whisper window for that user, and provides a history of all whispers in the chatlog between the GM and that player.

The package also contains a macro that you can use to launch a WhisperBox for a specific player instead of having to click on a token.
